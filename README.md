# Nicole Hammond - Python Problem Solver | Data Enthusiast | Automation Advocate

I spend my life learning skills to solve real-world problems. My programming journey began when I managed a team of insurance recovery agents and saw them spend hours on repetitive tasks. To improve efficiency, I used Google Apps Script to automate processes, freeing them to focus on more meaningful work.

But automation was just the beginning. I discovered the power of data. Massive amounts  of data were collected, yet little value was extracted. So, I dived into Excel, Python, and Power BI to analyze and visualize complex datasets, leading to profit-boosting insights, productivity improvements, and enhanced client satisfaction.

## üîß Real-World Solutions I've Built
- Identification Number verification:
  I built an application with a simple UI that allows a user to provide an ID number and select one or more options on feedback they want regarding the ID number. Options are: 1) Date of Birth 2) Age 3) Gender 4) Citizen or Permanent Resident 5) Is the ID number provided valid 
- Employee Tax Calculator
  Built with Python & Flask, it streamlined tax calculations, reducing manual effort while ensuring accuracy.
- Predictive Rainfall Model
  I educated myself on predictive analytics to determine the best time to plant a lawn based on historical rainfall data.
- Automated Google Sheets 
  Used Google Apps Script to optimize workflow for insurance recovery agents.
- Stock Management System
  Designed a desktop solution integrated with Google Sheets via API for seamless tracking.
  
## üìö My Continuous Learning Path
I dream of working in a collaborative team, solving challenging problems, and expanding my knowledge every day until I can confidently call myself a Python expert.
To build my portfolio, I‚Äôm currently continuously building python applications to expand my knowldege. I am currently concentrating specifically on python for automation of repetative tasks and testing.

## üéì Business & Data Background
I hold a Postgraduate Certificate focusing on data analysis, finance, and people.
In the later years of my career I realized that the reason I was excelling in the finance and insurance industry was due to my ability to recognize patterns in the fineset of details, solve problems with logical solutions, constantly and quickly aquiring needed skills to get the job done and my curiosity. In the process of solving problems I found my passion for programming. 
üîç Always eager to learn, build, and innovate‚Äîlet's connect!

## Who am I Outside of Work
I enjoy good food, good wine and a cold beer on a warm day.
I love cooking delicious meals with fresh produce, but cannot bake to save my life.
I am a mother and wife to a house full of gamers.
I am the type of wife who did not allow my husband to plant a new lawn until I had build a model to predict when we could expect the rain season to start.
I live to work, but not in the unhealthy way. I love what I do. Every project, solution or task completed brings me joy. My career is my hobby and my passion. When you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.
