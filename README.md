# Nicole Hammond - Backend Developer | Data Enthusiast | Automation Advocate

I spend my life learning skills to solve real-world problems. My programming journey began when I managed a team of insurance recovery agents and saw them spend hours on repetitive tasks. To improve efficiency, I used Google Apps Script to automate processes, freeing them to focus on more meaningful work.

But automation was just the beginning. I discovered the power of data. Massive amounts  of data were collected, yet little value was extracted. So, I dived into Excel, Python, and Power BI to analyze and visualize complex datasets, leading to profit-boosting insights, productivity improvements, and enhanced client satisfaction.

## üîß Real-World Solutions I've Built
- SAP Workflow Notifier
Automates detection of stagnant SAP documents and routes alerts to the appropriate users across Slack, Teams, or Email ‚Äî all without touching the code. Configured via a GUI, it replaces manual checks with real-time notifications and transforms the workflow follow-up process into a hands-free system. Aimed at eliminating delays and unnecessary emails, it encourages action to happens the moment it's needed.

- Excel/CSV Processing App 
Automates client data conversion from legacy exports to clean, import-ready formats. Supports 
nested ZIP folders, geo-referencing, and applies client-specific logic for transforming and mapping 
fields. Turns manual efforts that take implementation consultants days to complete into a 5 minute 
process. 
 
- ID Number Verification App 
Validates South African ID numbers for accuracy and completeness using built-in logic checks and 
pattern matching.

- Stock Management Desktop App 
A sleek inventory tracker that syncs with Google Sheets via API, enabling real-time updates, central 
record-keeping, and offline usability.

- Automated Reporting System (Google Apps Script) 
Pulls data from multiple Google Sheets, compiles and formats it into comprehensive, ready-to-use 
reports ‚Äî eliminating repetitive manual effort.

- Automated CRM Reporting Email 
Built a fully automated system that extracts and cleans CRM data weekly, attaches it to a scheduled 
email, and sends it to designated team members. The mailing list and schedule are easily 
customizable, eliminating manual effort while maintaining flexibility

- Employee Tax Calculator 
Performs PAYE, UIF and net salary calculations based on input salary figures and tax brackets, ideal 
for small businesses or HR teams. Deployed with Heroku.

- Directory Cleanup Tool 
Scans and organizes folder structures, based on pre-defined user needs. Organizes files into folders 
based on user specifications and removes redundant/temporary files that are no longer needed.

- KPI Tracking & Interactive Dashboards
Designed dashboards in Excel to monitor key performance indicators, visualize trends, and empower 
data-driven decisions. Integrated dropdown filters, conditional formatting, charts, and dynamic 
formulas for interactivity.

- Rainfall Prediction Model 
Uses historical weather data and pattern analysis to make forecasts. 
  
## üìö My Continuous Learning Path
I dream of working in a collaborative team, solving challenging problems, and expanding my knowledge every day until I can confidently call myself a Python expert.
To build my portfolio, I‚Äôm currently continuously building python applications to expand my knowldege. I am currently concentrating specifically on python for automation of repetative tasks and testing.

## üéì Business & Data Background
I hold a Postgraduate Certificate focusing on data analysis, finance, and people.
In the later years of my career I realized that the reason I was excelling in the finance and insurance industry was due to my ability to recognize patterns in the fineset of details, solve problems with logical solutions, constantly and quickly aquiring needed skills to get the job done and my curiosity. In the process of solving problems I found my passion for programming. 
üîç Always eager to learn, build, and innovate‚Äîlet's connect!

## Who am I Outside of Work
I enjoy good food, good wine and a cold beer on a warm day.
I love cooking delicious meals with fresh produce, but aside from sourdough bread cannot bake to save my life.
I am a mother and wife to a house full of gamers.
I am the type of wife who did not allow my husband to plant a new lawn until I had build a model to predict when we could expect the rain season to start.
I live to work, but not in the unhealthy way. I love what I do. Every project, solution or task completed brings me joy. My career is my hobby and my passion. When you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.
