# Nicole Hammond - Backend Developer | Data Enthusiast | Automation Advocate

Iâ€™ve dedicated my career to mastering the skills needed to solve real-world problems through thoughtful, reliable technology. My programming journey began while managing a team of insurance recovery agents, where I noticed how much time was lost to repetitive, manual tasks. To boost efficiency, I taught myself Google Apps Script and built automations that freed my team to focus on higher-value work.

That experience sparked my passion for backend development â€” building systems that quietly power productivity and enable others to do more. As I explored deeper challenges, I uncovered untapped potential in operational data: vast volumes were being collected, but little insight was being used. So I expanded into Excel automation, Python scripting, and Power BI to standardize messy datasets and extract meaningful patterns. These backend solutions led to measurable gains in profitability, efficiency, and client satisfaction.

Now, Iâ€™m focused on growing as a backend developer â€” designing resilient tools and scalable systems that support decision-making and automation across any environment.

## ðŸ”§ Real-World Solutions I've Built
- AI Prompt Optimizer
Prompt Optimizer streamlines prompt engineering by transforming fragmented developer inputs into well-structured, AI-ready instructions â€” no coding required. Through a form-based interface, users define task objectives, language preferences, and code context. The app then compiles detailed multi-part prompts tailored for maximum clarity and effectiveness. Designed to eliminate vague instructions and improve response quality, it empowers developers to get complete, ready-to-use code suggestions on the first try

- SAP Workflow Notifier
Automates detection of stagnant SAP documents and routes alerts to the appropriate users across Slack, Teams, or Email â€” all without touching the code. Configured via a GUI, it replaces manual checks with real-time notifications and transforms the workflow follow-up process into a hands-free system. Aimed at eliminating delays and unnecessary emails, it encourages action to happens the moment it's needed.

- Excel/CSV Processing App 
Automates client data conversion from legacy exports to clean, import-ready formats. Supports 
nested ZIP folders, geo-referencing, and applies client-specific logic for transforming and mapping 
fields. Turns manual efforts that take implementation consultants days to complete into a 5 minute 
process. 
 
- ID Number Verification App 
Validates South African ID numbers for accuracy and completeness using built-in logic checks and 
pattern matching.

- Stock Management Desktop App 
A sleek inventory tracker that syncs with Google Sheets via API, enabling real-time updates, central 
record-keeping, and offline usability.

- Automated Reporting System (Google Apps Script) 
Pulls data from multiple Google Sheets, compiles and formats it into comprehensive, ready-to-use 
reports â€” eliminating repetitive manual effort.

- Automated CRM Reporting Email 
Built a fully automated system that extracts and cleans CRM data weekly, attaches it to a scheduled 
email, and sends it to designated team members. The mailing list and schedule are easily 
customizable, eliminating manual effort while maintaining flexibility

- Employee Tax Calculator 
Performs PAYE, UIF and net salary calculations based on input salary figures and tax brackets, ideal 
for small businesses or HR teams. Deployed with Heroku.

- Directory Cleanup Tool 
Scans and organizes folder structures, based on pre-defined user needs. Organizes files into folders 
based on user specifications and removes redundant/temporary files that are no longer needed.

- KPI Tracking & Interactive Dashboards
Designed dashboards in Excel to monitor key performance indicators, visualize trends, and empower 
data-driven decisions. Integrated dropdown filters, conditional formatting, charts, and dynamic 
formulas for interactivity.

- Rainfall Prediction Model 
Uses historical weather data and pattern analysis to make forecasts. 
  
## ðŸ“š My Continuous Learning Path
Iâ€™m on a journey to become a confident backend developer â€” someone who builds systems that automate, scale, and support real-world impact. I dream of collaborating with driven teams, solving challenging problems, and expanding my knowledge every day until I can truly call myself a coding expert.

To build my portfolio, Iâ€™m continuously developing my programming skills, with a current focus on automation of repetitive tasks and testing frameworks that increase reliability and save time. Each project strengthens my backend development skills and deepens my understanding of building adaptable, maintainable solutions.

In September 2025, Iâ€™ll begin my MSc in Computer Science â€” a milestone in my transition toward a full-time backend engineering role. My learning so far includes:

### Degrees & Specializations
- Postgraduate Certificate in Business Administration â€” Edinburgh Business School (2025)

- Microsoft Power BI (PL-300) Certification (2024)
- IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate (2024)

### Foundational Credentials
- Fundamentals of Accounting Certificate â€” Alison (2019)
- Diploma in Business and Legal Studies â€” Alison (2018)
- Communication & Networking Skills Certificate â€” Alison (2018

## Who am I Outside of Work
I enjoy good food, good wine and a cold beer on a warm day.
I love cooking delicious meals with fresh produce, but aside from sourdough bread cannot bake to save my life.
I am a mother and wife to a house full of gamers.
I am the type of wife who did not allow my husband to plant a new lawn until I had build a model to predict when we could expect the rain season to start.
I live to work, but not in the unhealthy way. I love what I do. Every project, solution or task completed brings me joy. My career is my hobby and my passion. When you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.
