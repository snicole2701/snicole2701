# Nicole Hammond - Project Manager | Team Leader | Automation Strategist | Department Head (South Africa)

I specialize in leading complex, multi-stream projects that drive operational efficiency, reduce costs, and elevate team performance. With 10 years of experience across property management, legal recovery, and enterprise operations, I’ve built a career around solving real-world problems through strategic leadership and smart automation.

My journey began in finance and insurance recovery, where I led teams managing 500–1000 active files for major insurers. I identified inefficiencies, restructured workflows, and spearheaded client onboarding and compliance initiatives. Later, I transitioned into freelance consulting, delivering automation-driven solutions for global corporations — including a custom payroll implementation app that eliminated manual effort and human error.


## What I Have Been Up To:
- Lead remote and hybrid teams with clarity and empathy
- Managed multiple concurrent projects across different phases with zero missed deadlines
- Draft business requirements, build project plans, and oversee full delivery cycles
- Design and implement automation systems using Google Sheets, Apps Script, and Power BI
- Communicate professionally with senior stakeholders and executive teams
- Payroll Implementation Automation: Built a custom app for a global payroll firm to eliminate manual onboarding
- ClickUp & Asana Setup: Designed workflows, automations, and reporting systems for operational teams
- Google Sheets Integrations: Connected platforms to reduce repetitive tasks and improve data accuracy
- Client Onboarding & Compliance: Led operational overhauls for legal and insurance recovery firms
- Multi-Project Management: Oversaw 3+ large-scale initiatives simultaneously for enterprise clients

## What I’m Looking For
I’m seeking a long-term remote role where I can lead impactful projects and collaborate with driven teams. I thrive in environments that value initiative, structure, and results — and I bring all three.
“I’m not a jack of all trades — I’ve chosen each opportunity to build a foundation strong enough to lead large teams and projects with confidence.”

## Who am I Outside of Work
I enjoy good food, good wine and a cold beer on a warm day.
I love cooking delicious meals with fresh produce, but aside from sourdough bread cannot bake to save my life.
I am a mother and wife to a house full of gamers.
I live to work, but not in the unhealthy way. I love what I do. Every project, solution or task completed brings me joy. My career is my hobby and my passion. When you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.
