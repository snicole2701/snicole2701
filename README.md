# Nicole Hammond - Python Problem Solver | Data Enthusiast | Automation Advocate

I spend my life learning skills to solve real-world problems. My journey began when I managed a team of insurance recovery agents and saw them spend hours on repetitive tasks. To improve efficiency, I learned Google Apps Script and automated processes, freeing them to focus on more meaningful work.

But automation was just the beginning. I discovered the power of data—massive amounts were collected, yet little value was extracted. So, I dived into Excel, Python, and Power BI to analyze and visualize complex datasets, leading to profit-boosting insights, productivity improvements, and enhanced client satisfaction.

## 🔧 Real-World Solutions I've Built
- Employee Tax Calculator  Built with Python & Flask, it streamlined tax calculations, reducing manual effort while ensuring accuracy.
- Predictive Rainfall Model  I educated myself on predictive analytics to determine the best time to plant a lawn based on historical rainfall data.
- Automated Competitive Analysis  Used Google Apps Script to optimize workflow for insurance recovery agents.
- Stock Management System  Designed a desktop solution integrated with Google Sheets via API for seamless tracking.
  
## 📚 My Continuous Learning Path
I dream of working in a collaborative team, solving challenging problems, and expanding my knowledge every day until I can confidently call myself a Python expert.
To build my developer portfolio, I’m currently educating myself in JavaScript and HTML, ensuring I can develop every aspect of my profile website myself.
